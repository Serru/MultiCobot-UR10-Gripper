The phases you see in the diagram are for orientation. You can go through them in the order you wish. The diagram has been divided into phases so that you can follow a sequence and know which element of the diagram is being worked on. In this case, it starts with Phase 1, followed by Phase 2, and finally ends with Phase 3. Note that there may be configurations in one phase that actually belong to another phase. If this is the case, it will be marked accordingly.

Phase 1: Gazebo simulator configuration
</h2>
</a>

### :book: `Gazebo` configuration
The first thing to do is to configure the `Gazebo` and the controllers so that it can properly simulate the cobot's movements. The package `one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo` will be created, which will contain all the configurations for `Gazebo`, including the controllers. 

Once the package is created, you will need to configure the controllers that are stored in the `controller` directory. The controllers are defined in files with the extension *yaml*. To define these controllers, you must give them a name and specify the type of controller, the dynamic `joints` you want to control, the constraints it has, the publishing ratio and other options. 

The contents of the driver configuration files are shown below. All of these drivers generally follow the structure mentioned above. The definition of the controllers can be contained in a single file, the only important thing is that `Gazebo` loads them correctly. These controllers are briefly explained below: 

- File [arm_controller_ur10.yaml](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo/controller/arm_controller_ur10.yaml): This file defines the controller for the UR10 cobot. It defines the controller name `arm_controller`, the controller type element `controllers/JointTrajectoryController` which contains the definition of the message type and the proper formatting of the information needed to communicate with the controller. Then there is the `joints` field that specifies which `joints` of the robot are part of the controller, all of these `joints` being dynamic. The other fields are left untouched, but care must be taken to name them consistently. 

- File [joint_state_controller.yaml](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo/controller/joint_state_controller.yaml): This file does not actually define a controller as such, its function is that of an interface that translates the `joint` information coming from the real cobot and converts it into `JointState` type messages that are later published. It is essential for correct operation both in simulation and with the real robot. It is part of the package *ROS* *ros_control*.

#### :computer: Create solution directory
```bash
cd ~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/multirobot
mkdir one_arm_no_moveit
``` 

#### :computer: Starting `Gazebo`
Currently it is not possible to run `Gazebo` with the robot from the created directory of the project. The first step is to start `Gazebo` with the UR10 robot. 

To bring some order to the structure of the project to be implemented, the use of the different tools and their files will be separated if possible. This allows a better understanding of the structure and facilitates later debugging. 

Therefore, instead of a directory, a package will be created that contains everything related to `Gazebo`:

```bash
cd ~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit
catkin_create_pkg one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo rospy
``` 

In the directory created for `Gazebo` it copies the directory *ur_gazebo*, the folders *controller* and *launch*.

```bash
cd ~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo
cp -r ~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/universal_robot/ur_gazebo/controller .
cp -r ~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/universal_robot/ur_gazebo/launch .
```
It compiles: 

```bash
cd ~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper
catkin_make
``` 

With this you can now start `Gazebo` from the project directory. 

```bash
roslaunch one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo ur10.launch
``` 

#### :computer: `Gazebo`'s world setup

Now we proceed to create the world with the robot and an environment where it can perform simple tasks. This project focuses on the tasks that the robot can perform, so it is not necessary for the world to be very detailed. 

For this purpose, you must first create the *world* directory where the created worlds will be stored:

```bash
cd ~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo
mkdir world
``` 

The file `world` from another [repository](https://github.com/Infinity8sailor/multiple_arm_setup/tree/main/multiple_ur_description/) is used, which provides a very simple scenario that allows later debugging of the robot's tasks.

```bash
cd ~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo
git clone https://github.com/Infinity8sailor/multiple_arm_setup.git
cp -r multiple_arm_setup/multiple_ur_description/models/ .
cp -r multiple_arm_setup/multiple_ur_description/world/ .
sudo rm -r multiple_arm_setup
``` 

To add the `world` with the robot in `Gazebo` you have to change the file [ur10.launch](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo/launch/ur10.launch) in the directory *launch*:

```bash
cd ~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo/launch
nano ur10.launch
``` 

And include the world in *launch* by adding the `world` argument and replacing the value of *default* in the *world_name* argument:

```xml
 <arg name="world" default="$(find one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo)/world/multiarm_bot.world" />

  <!-- startup simulated world -->
  <include file="$(find gazebo_ros)/launch/empty_world.launch">
    <arg name="world_name" default="$(arg world)"/>
    <arg name="paused" value="$(arg paused)"/>
    <arg name="gui" value="$(arg gui)"/>
  </include>
``` 

We proceed to launch `Gazebo` with the new world: 

```bash
roslaunch one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo ur10.launch
``` 

When launching it, it shows two errors: 

```bash
Error [parser.cc:581] Unable to find uri[model://dropbox]
``` 

This error can only be fixed if the model is created from scratch, since it is not provided by `Gazebo` or has been removed. Therefore, the object *dropbox* in the [multiarm_bot.world](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo/world/multiarm_bot.world) file is commented:

```xml
<!--include>
       <pose frame=''>0.5 0.0 0.3 0 0 0</pose> 
       <uri>model://dropbox</uri>
       <name>DropBox</name>
</include-->
``` 

--- 

```bash
[ERROR] [1639740881.902412642, 0.057000000]: GazeboRosControlPlugin missing <legacyModeNS> while using DefaultRobotHWSim, defaults to true.
This setting assumes you have an old package with an old implementation of DefaultRobotHWSim, where the robotNamespace is disregarded and absolute paths are used instead.
If you do not want to fix this issue in an old package just set <legacyModeNS> to true.
``` 

To fix this error, we make the change in the file [~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/universal_robot/ur_descriptiom/urdf/common.gazebo.xacro](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/universal_robot/ur_description/urdf/common.gazebo.xacro) and add  *<legacymodens>* to the file: 

```xml
<plugin name="ros_control" filename="libgazebo_ros_control.so">
      <!--robotNamespace>/</robotNamespace-->
      <!--robotSimType>gazebo_ros_control/DefaultRobotHWSim</robotSimType-->
      <legacyModeNS>true</legacyModeNS>
</plugin>
``` 

#### :computer: Installing `Gazebo` 9 [Optional]
There could be a *warning* that is a problem if ignored when simulating the arm behavior in the future. 

```bash
[ WARN] [1639745803.729749460, 0.061000000]: The default_robot_hw_sim plugin is using the Joint::SetPosition method without preserving the link velocity.
[ WARN] [1639745803.729772883, 0.061000000]: As a result, gravity will not be simulated correctly for your model.
[ WARN] [1639745803.729786659, 0.061000000]: Please set gazebo_pid parameters, switch to the VelocityJointInterface or EffortJointInterface, or upgrade to Gazebo 9.
``` 

To this end, it was decided to install `Gazebo` 9 in the *ROS Kinetic Kame* environment.

```bash
sudo apt-get remove ros-kinetic-desktop-full
sudo apt-get remove ros-kinetic-gazebo*
sudo apt-get upgrade

sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ros-base

sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list'
cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list
wget https://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-gazebo9-ros-pkgs ros-kinetic-gazebo9-ros-control ros-kinetic-gazebo9*

sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-catkin

sudo apt-get install rviz

sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-controller-manager ros-kinetic-joint-state-controller ros-kinetic-joint-trajectory-controller ros-kinetic-rqt ros-kinetic-rqt-controller-manager ros-kinetic-rqt-joint-trajectory-controller ros-kinetic-ros-control ros-kinetic-rqt-gui

sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rqt-plot ros-kinetic-rqt-graph ros-kinetic-rqt-rviz ros-kinetic-rqt-tf-tree

sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-gazebo9-ros ros-kinetic-kdl-conversions ros-kinetic-kdl-parser ros-kinetic-forward-command-controller ros-kinetic-tf-conversions ros-kinetic-xacro ros-kinetic-joint-state-publisher ros-kinetic-robot-state-publisher

sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ros-control ros-kinetic-ros-controllers
``` 

The result after installing `Gazebo` 9 looks similar to the following.

<h2>
Phase 2: URDF configuration
</h2>
</a>

### :book: Description of the *URDF* file
The *URDF* (United Robotics Description Format) file models the cobot in *XML* format, which is used by the various applications that *ROS* requires, but mainly to perform a simulation of the modeled robot. 

The file is built in the form of a tree in which there are three main tags: `<robot>`, `<link>` and `<joint>`. For clarity, you can take the arm of the human body as a reference. If you want to model the arm of a person, the tag `<robot>` would represent the arm as a whole. This arm consists of several bones (humerus, ulna and radius) represented by tag `<link>` and a joint connecting these bones (elbow) represented by tag `<joint>`. 

As with bones, additional information about size, geometry, inertia, orientation, etc. can be added to these tags. Finally, the modeling of a robot can be connected to another model to form a more complex model that can be represented by adding the hand to the arm, where the wrist is a joint that connects the two. Note that `<joint>` tags connect ` <link> ` tags via a parent-child relationship.

This creates a representation of the robot components: 

![image](/doc/imgs_md/urdf-robot.png "URDF file representation") 

The image shows the contents of the [*URDF* file](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_description/urdf/ur10_robot.urdf.xacro) that models the robot next to the gripper. You can see how the component of the UR10 robot arm is connected to the link `world` which represents the `world` (yellow color) and the base of the UR10 arm `base_link` (green color) which is directly above it, also the joint `world_joint` is the yellow ball located between both links. In the same way, the component of the gripper `robotiq_85_gripper` is connected to the arm of the UR10 (`ur10_robot`). The ball representing the joint `robotiq_85_base_joint` connecting both components (purple color) connects the link `robotiq_85_base_link` of the gripper with the link `ee_link` of the UR10 arm.


#### :computer: :warning: Adding the robotiq_2f_85_gripper to the UR10 robot [Not possible, problems with `Gazebo`]

To add the gripper correctly, you must first understand how it works. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/Danfoa/robotiq_2finger_grippers). 

Take a look at the following image to understand how the gripper control works:
![gripper schematic](/doc/imgs_md/robotiq_2f_85_gripper.png "gripper controller") 

You can see 2 nodes, one acting as a client and the other as a server. The *server* is responsible for sending jobs to the gripper and feedback to the client and the *client* sends jobs to the server. 

If we compare the configuration of the controller with that of the UR10, we notice that the concept is different because there is no *yaml* file that loads the necessary information to control the gripper. Instead, it is the server that creates the *topic*s `/command_robotiq_action` and `/robotiq_controller/follow_joint_trajectory`, both of which are of type `action`.

```bash
miguel@Omen:~$ rostopic list
/clicked_point
/command_robotiq_action/cancel
/command_robotiq_action/feedback
/command_robotiq_action/goal
/command_robotiq_action/result
/command_robotiq_action/status
/initialpose
/joint_states
/move_base_simple/goal
/robotiq_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/cancel
/robotiq_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/feedback
/robotiq_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/goal
/robotiq_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/result
/robotiq_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/status
/rosout
/rosout_agg
/tf
/tf_static
``` 

Knowing this, to control the gripper, there is an example in the file [robotiq_2f_action_client_example.py](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/robotiq_2finger_grippers/robotiq_2f_gripper_control/scripts/robotiq_2f_action_client_example.py) and can work with a simulated gripper or the real gripper. Bearing this in mind, when adding the gripper to the UR10 robot, the *yaml* file that would load the driver controller is not necessary, but the node that will act as the server must be launched correctly and if you look at the server code and from the client, special care must be taken with the configuration of the *topic*s and *namespace*s. 

The file that uploads the UR10 robot is [~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/universal_robot/ur_description/launch/ur10_upload.launch](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/universal_robot/ur_description/launch/ur10_upload.launch), therefore, we will copy what is necessary from the *ur_description* package and modify it to add the gripper to the robot and also modify the file [ur10.launch](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/universal_robot/ur_gazebo/launch/ur10.launch) which loads the *URDF* of the *ur_gazebo* package: 

```bash
cd ~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit
catkin_create_pkg one_arm_no_moveit_description rospy
cd one_arm_no_moveit_description
mkdir launch
cp ~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/universal_robot/ur_description/launch/ur10_upload.launch launch/
mkdir urdf
cp ~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/universal_robot/ur_description/urdf/ur10_robot.urdf.xacro udrf/
cp ~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/universal_robot/ur_description/urdf/ur10_joint_limited_robot.urdf.xacro udrf/
``` 

The exact reason why it is not possible to simulate the gripper correctly is not known, because `Gazebo` shows the following error:

```bash
[ERROR] [1640030309.858708751, 1040.204000000]: This robot has a joint named "finger_joint" which is not in the gazebo model.
[FATAL] [1640030309.858805517, 1040.204000000]: Could not initialize robot simulation interface
``` 

It does not work in the simulation with `Gazebo`, but it does in the *Rosviz* tool. This indicates that the *ROS* package for the gripper works correctly, but the simulated robot configuration in `Gazebo` (real robot) is not correct. Surely they should be treated as independent elements that physically work as a whole, which is not the case with this simulation in `Gazebo`. 

![rviz-robotiq-2f-85-gripper](/doc/imgs_md/robotiq_2f_85_gripper_rviz.png "rviz-robotiq-2f-85-gripper") 

Since the gripper in the real robot is an independent element of the robot arm, this repository may be necessary, but for the simulations another repository compatible with the `Gazebo` simulator is used.


#### :computer: Adding the robotiq_85_gripper to the UR10 robot
In the process of adding the gripper to the UR10 robot. There are no clear instructions on how to do this properly. So let us first look at how the package is built to get an idea of how to adapt it to the project in question.

```bash
LICENSE             robotiq_85_description  robotiq_85_moveit_config  si_utils
README.md           robotiq_85_driver       robotiq_85_msgs
robotiq_85_bringup  robotiq_85_gripper      robotiq_85_simulation
``` 

At first glance, the packages we are interested in are *robotiq_85_description*, *robotiq_85_bringup* and *robotiq_85_simulation*, the rest are resources for use with `MoveIt!` or scripts used later to control the gripper in the simulation. 

In this sense, the gripper is built into the UR10 robot. 

For example, take the file [~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/robotiq_85_gripper/robotiq_85_description/urdf/robotiq_85_gripper.xacro](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/robotiq_85_gripper/robotiq_85_description/urdf/robotiq_85_gripper.xacro) and insert the gripper into the robot by changing the files: 

- [~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_description/urdf/ur10_robot.urdf.xacro](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_description/urdf/ur10_robot.urdf.xacro)
- [~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_description/urdf/ur10_joint_limited_robot.urdf.xacro](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_description/urdf/ur10_joint_limited_robot.urdf.xacro). 

And with that you have the gripper on the UR10 robot. You can see the gripper on the picture.
![ ](/doc/imgs_md/ur10_con_gripper_85.png "ur10 with gripper")

--- 

#### :computer: Gripper Controller Aggregation (Gazebo, phase 1) 

Now the controllers are missing to send orders to the gripper. You can check this by looking in the list of active *topic*s to see that there is no controller for the gripper:

```bash
miguel@Omen:~$ rostopic list
/arm_controller/command
/arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/cancel
/arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/feedback
/arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/goal
/arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/result
/arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/status
/arm_controller/state
/calibrated
/clock
/gazebo/link_states
/gazebo/model_states
/gazebo/parameter_descriptions
/gazebo/parameter_updates
/gazebo/performance_metrics
/gazebo/set_link_state
/gazebo/set_model_state
/gazebo_gui/parameter_descriptions
/gazebo_gui/parameter_updates
/joint_group_position_controller/command
/joint_states
/rosout
/rosout_agg
/tf
/tf_static
``` 

You can see that the UR10 robot controllers are loaded (**/arm_controller**), but there is no *topic* for the gripper controller. To change this you need to add them as follows and load them correctly in `Gazebo`. 

The files with the gripper control information are located in the directories [~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/robotiq_85_gripper/robotiq_85_simulation/robotiq_85_gazebo/controller](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/tree/main/src/robotiq_85_gripper/robotiq_85_simulation/robotiq_85_gazebo/controller) and [~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/robotiq_85_gripper/robotiq_85_simulation/robotiq_85_gazebo/launch](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/tree/main/src/robotiq_85_gripper/robotiq_85_simulation/robotiq_85_gazebo/launch), which points to the *controller* and *launch* directories of the [one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/tree/main/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo). 

Finally, the following changes were made:

```bash
cd ~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo/controller
cp ~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/robotiq_85_gripper/robotiq_85_simulation/robotiq_85_gazebo/controller/gripper_controller_robotiq.yaml .
``` 

And at the end of the file [~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo/launch/ur10.launch](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo/launch/ur10.launch) added the gripper controller: 

```xml
<!-- robotiq_85_gripper controller -->
  <rosparam file="$(find one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo)/controller/gripper_controller_robotiq.yaml" command="load"/> 
  <node name="gripper_controller_spawner" pkg="controller_manager" type="spawner" args="gripper" />
``` 

Restart `Gazebo` (*roslaunch one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo ur10.launch*) and with the command *rostopic list* you can see that the gripper controllers are displayed correctly (**/gripper**):

```bash
/arm_controller/command
/arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/cancel
/arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/feedback

<h2>
Phase 3: Implementation of a custom motion planner that performs a <i>pick & place</i>
</h2>
</a>

### :book: Creating the motion planner and helper nodes 

The *ROS* policy of splitting tasks into nodes is followed whenever possible to facilitate future reuse. 

![image](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/doc/imgs_md/Diseno-planificador-fase-2.png "Scheme for creating your own motion planner") 

In the figure you can see the schema for the structure of the implemented planner architecture. You can see two sections: `Gazebo` (the nodes in red color and the *topic*s in orange color) and the planner (the nodes in blue color and the *topic*s in green color), divided in this way to facilitate the explanation. 

The `Gazebo` group of nodes and *topic*s did not need to be touched and their existence was exploited to obtain the necessary information to allow the planner to perform its task. This group communicates with the planning group through three *topic*s `/tf` that contain information about robot transformations, and the *topic*s `/gripper/command` and `/arm_controller/command` that receive the necessary information to execute movements in the robot. 

Since these nodes and *topic*s are known to the `Gazebo` group, the solution for the planner is to communicate with them to get the needed information. The node `ur10_robot_pose` receives the transformation information and sends the position of the *end-effector* to the node `robot_manipulator`, which performs two main functions: The first is controlling the gripper and the second is planning the trajectory of the effector. The 'cmd_gripper_value_pub' and 'cmd_ik_trajectory_pub' nodes receive commands from the 'robot_manipulator' node and send them directly to the *topic*s of the controllers of 'Gazebo' ('/gripper/command' and '/arm_controller/command').

Having explained how the solution works in general, we now explain what each node does in detail: 

- [ur10_robot_pose](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo/scripts/ur10_robot_pose.py): This script creates a node that posts only the position of the *end-effector* with a given frequency (10 Hz) via the *tf* library of *ROS*, i.e. it obtains the position of the *end-effector* from the information of the *topic* `/tf` published in the *topic* `/robot_pose`. The position of the *end-effector* is obtained from the difference between the positions of `/base_link` and `/ee_link` (the link that connects to the gripper). This node is not really necessary, the `robot_manipulator` node could do this itself, albeit redundantly, but very useful for debugging and understanding how the motion planner works.
- [pub_gripper_cmd](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo/scripts/pub_gripper_cmd.py): The script creates a node that only receives commands from *topic* `/pub_gripper_control` and forwards them to *topic* gripper controller `/gripper/command`. Although the functionality is simple, this node allows changes to the value sent to the controller at any time because it does not perform a check to see if the move was executed correctly, which is a desired behavior. And if it does not receive an order, it continues to publish the previous order and keeps the value of the gripper. If it receives a new order, it immediately discards the previous value so that changes can be made while a move is executing.
- [pub_ik_trajectory](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo/scripts/pub_ik_trajectory.py): Works the same way as described for the `cmd_gripper_value_pub` node, this script instantiates the `cmd_ik_trajectory_pub` node. It receives commands from the *topic* `/pub_ik_trajectory` to which it subscribes and transmits them to the arm controller *topic* `/arm_controller/command`. Also, changes can be made while executing a trajectory, allowing sudden changes in direction without having to wait until the previously specified position is reached.
- [robot_manipulator](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_manipulator/scripts/robot_manipulator.py): This script instantiates the `robot_manipulator` node and determines the current position of the *end-effector* of the *topic* `/robot_pose`. This information is necessary to determine the values of each joint needed to achieve the desired Cartesian position. Once the value that the joints must have is determined, they are published via the *topic* `/pub_ik_trajectory`. We had to implement a [script that works as a library](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_manipulator/scripts/kinematics_utils.py). This library consists of several functions that perform the necessary calculations to obtain the forward kinematics and the inverse kinematics. In the case of the gripper, since only the value of a joint needs to be controlled, no computation is required; the desired value is simply passed to the function. In the implementation, it is necessary to take into account the type of messages that the controllers must receive in order to set them correctly, otherwise they will not perform any movements or they will perform undesirable movements. This solution can lead to problems since singularities can occur because divisions by zero can occur when calculating the equations, especially when two joints are aligned. To avoid this, the robot's workspace was simply constrained in this case.

#### :computer: robot_pose_publisher script
We will implement a node that publishes the position of the end effector `ee_link` at any time, using the library *tf*. 

Since this is a tool and not a script that gives commands to the robot, this script will be provided in the `Gazebo` directory.

```bash
cd ~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo/scripts
touch ur10_robot_pose.py
chmod +x ur10_robot_pose.py
```

This node calculates the position of the `ee_link` relative to the position of the `base_link` using the *tf* library and publishes it in the *topic* `\robot_pose`. This allows you to quickly determine the current position of the gripper. 

- To automatically launch the file, add the following to the [~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo/launch/controller_utils.launch](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo/launch/controller_utils.launch) file.

```

#### :computer: pub_gripper_cmd script
It enables the control of the gripper. For this purpose, a node is created that listens to a *topic* (`/pub_gripper_control`) from which it receives the value it sends to the controller via the *topic* `/gripper/command`. 

This node is a support node, it is located next to the `Gazebo` scripts, near the driver files:

```bash
cd ~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo/scripts
touch pub_gripper_cmd.py
chmod +x pub_gripper_cmd.py
```

- To launch the file automatically, add the following to the [~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo/launch/controller_utils.launch](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo/launch/controller_utils.launch) file.

<!-- send the gripper commands [Own Script]-->
  <node name="cmd_gripper_value_pub" pkg="one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo" type="pub_gripper_cmd.py" respawn="true" />
``` 

--- 

#### :computer: pub_ik_trajectory script
A node is implemented that receives commands via the *topic* `/pub_ik_trajectory` and sends them repeatedly to the robot controllers. The position it has to move to is changed when it receives new commands. 

Since this is a tool and not a script that gives commands to the robot, this script is implemented in the `Gazebo` directory, just like in the previous section.

```bash
cd ~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo/scripts
touch pub_ik_trajectory.py
chmod +x pub_ik_trajectory.py

- To automatically launch the file, add the following to the [~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo/launch/controller_utils.launch](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo/launch/controller_utils.launch) file.

```xml
  <!-- send the arms commands [Own Script]-->
  <node name="cmd_ik_trajectory_pub" pkg="one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo" type="pub_ik_trajectory.py" respawn="true" />
``` 

--- 

#### :computer: robot_manipulator script
We will implement a node that receives the information received from the `robot_pose_publisher` node and sends the trajectories to the `pub_ik_trajectory` node. 

To get the values of the joints based on the Cartesian position you want to move to, you need to implement the *Inverse Kinematics* and *Forward Kinematics* functions. These functions were taken from [The Construct](https://www.theconstructsim.com/) and adapted. 

For this:

```bash 
cd ~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_manipulator/scripts
touch kinematics_utils.py
chmod +x kinematics_utils.py
```
- Displays the contents of the [kinematics_utils.py](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_manipulator/scripts/kinematics_utils.py) library. 

Once the library is implemented, we proceed to develop the node that sends commands to the robot to perform the desired tasks, in this case *pick & place*, where the cobot picks a cube from the table and places it in a basket until there are no more cubes on the table. 

```bash
cd ~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_manipulator/scripts
touch robot_manipulator.py
chmod +x robot_manipulator.py
``` 

It contains a set of functions to send the final trajectories correctly and get the values of the `joints` in the position of the robot. 

- See the contents of the library [robot_manipulator.py](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_manipulator/scripts/robot_manipulator.py). 

The robot has problems depending on the coordinates passed, since singularities can occur if the robot is blocked by constraints on the mathematical domain (for example: if `theta2 = acos(1)`, the value is undefined and generates an error or divisions for zero). 

To avoid this, a *workspace* can be defined where these singularities do not occur.

### :computer: Testing in `Gazebo`
A test was created where the robot grabs three wooden cubes and sends them into a container. 

The file with the manipulator code to perform the test: [~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_manipulator/scripts/robot_manipulator.py](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_manipulator/scripts/robot_manipulator.py) 

Commands to launch the test: 

- Terminal 1: 

```bash
cd ~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch one_arm_no_moveit_gazebo ur10_joint_limited.launch
``` 

- Terminal 2: 

```bash
cd ~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun one_arm_no_moveit_manipulator robot_manipulator.py
``` 

### :book: Problems with pick & place testing
At the beginning of the tests it turned out that in the simulation in `Gazebo` it is not possible to pick up the objects on the table. 

This is due to the absence of the `Gazebo` plugin *gazebo_grasp*, which is included in the package *gazebo-pkgs*, previously installed as a resource.

#### :computer: Gazebo Grasp Plugin
We now perform the necessary steps to load the plugin that will allow the robot to interact with the objects in the simulation. 

First, we need the file *gzplugin_grasp_fix.urdf.xacro* (you can get it from the repository of [Jennifer Buehler](https://github-wiki-see.page/m/JenniferBuehler/gazebo-pkgs/wiki/The-Gazebo-grasp-fix-plugin)). It could be stored in the *universal robots* package, but since it is a modification for this project, it was decided to move it to the [~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/multirobot /one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_description/urdf](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/tree/main/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_description/urdf) directory.

```bash
cd ~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_description/urdf
touch gzplugin_grasp_fix.urdf.xacro
``` 

- See the contents of the file [gzplugin_grasp_fix.urdf.xacro](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_description/urdf/gzplugin_grasp_fix.urdf.xacro) . 

Once you have the `Gazebo` plugin, you need to add it to the robot arm. The code to increase friction has also been added to the gripper to help it grab objects in the simulation. 

```bash
nano ~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_description/urdf/ur10_robot.urdf.xacro
``` 

Add the plugin at the end: 

```xml
  <xacro:include filename="$(find one_arm_no_moveit_description)/urdf/gzplugin_grasp_fix.urdf.xacro"/>

  <xacro:gzplugin_grasp_fix prefix=""/>
``` 

- See the contents of the file [ur10_robot.urdf.xacro](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/multirobot/one_arm_no_moveit/one_arm_no_moveit_description/urdf/ur10_robot.urdf.xacro) . 

In the same way we edit the gripper file ([~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/robotiq_85_gripper/robotiq_85_description/urdf/robotiq_85_gripper.urdf.xacro](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/robotiq_85_gripper/robotiq_85_description/urdf/robotiq_85_gripper.urdf.xacro)): 

```bash
nano ~/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/src/robotiq_85_gripper/robotiq_85_description/urdf/robotiq_85_gripper.urdf.xacro
``` 

- View the contents of the [robotiq_85_gripper.urdf.xacro](https://github.com/Serru/MultiCobot-UR10-Gripper/blob/main/src/robotiq_85_gripper/robotiq_85_description/urdf/robotiq_85_gripper.urdf.xacro) file. 

This is all you need to configure the plugin correctly. If there are multiple robots, the plugin must be assigned correctly for each gripper, otherwise these grippers will not be able to grab objects during the simulation.
